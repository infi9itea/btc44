## Experiment Methodology
1. **Data Exploration & Preprocessing**
   - Data Analysis: We began by analyzing the distribution of images across different brain tumor classes to identify any potential imbalances.
   - Train/Validation/Test Split: The dataset was partitioned into standard training, validation, and testing sets to ensure robust and unbiased model evaluation.
   - Image Augmentation: To enhance the model's ability to generalize and prevent overfitting, we applied various augmentation techniques. As demonstrated in our RestNet experiments, we compared performance on both augmented and non-augmented data. The augmentation strategies included:
    Random rotations
    Horizontal and vertical flips
    Zooming and shearing
    Brightness adjustments

2. **Baseline Model**
    To establish a performance benchmark, we first developed a Convolutional Neural Network from the ground up.
   - Architecture: The model detailed in Custom_CNN.ipynb was a straightforward CNN with multiple convolutional and pooling layers, followed by dense layers for classification.
   - Performance Metrics: This initial model was evaluated on core metrics like accuracy, providing a baseline to measure the effectiveness of more complex, pre-trained architectures.

3. **Advanced Models**
    The core of our experimentation involved leveraging the power of transfer learning with several state-of-the-art architectures. Each model was fine-tuned on our brain tumor dataset.
   - CNN from Scratch: Our Custom_CNN.ipynb served as our primary from-scratch model.
   - Transfer Learning Models: We implemented and evaluated the following pre-trained models:

    ResNet: Explored in both RestNet on Augmented Data.ipynb and RestNet on Non-Augmented Data.ipynb to explicitly measure the impact of our data augmentation strategy.

    GoogleNet: Implemented in GoogleNet.ipynb.

    DenseNet: Implemented in Densenet.ipynb.

    EfficientNet: A modern, efficient architecture explored in EfficientNet.ipynb.

   - Hybrid Architecture: To push performance further, we designed and tested a novel hybrid model in Hybrid_CNN (Densenet + Restnet).ipynb, which combined features from both the DenseNet and ResNet architectures.

4. **Model Evaluation**
    The final phase involved a comprehensive evaluation of all trained models to determine the top performer.
   - Quantitative Metrics: We assessed each model using a suite of metrics including Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score to get a holistic view of performance.
   - Final Comparison: The results from all experiments were compiled to compare the architectures directly, leading to our final model selection based on empirical evidence.
